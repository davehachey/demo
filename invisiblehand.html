<h3>What Invisiblehand.com offers the world</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Invisiblehand.com is a market for buyers and sellers to meet</li>
    <li>Invisiblehand.com provides price discovery and enhanced liquidity for both</li>
  <ul>

<h3>How to make Invisiblehand.com work for you</h3>
<h5>Buyers</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Save money by buying in bulk!</li>
  <li>Save money by paying only what you want to pay</li>
  <li>Find producers who are providing exactly the products you want produced in the way you want them produced</li>

</ol>

<h4>Invisiblehand.com is not a substitute for the wonderful farmer's markets of Nova Scotia, but not all producers and consumers can make it to the markets. And sometimes both buyers and sellers want to buy or sell larger quantities</h4>
<h4>Restaurants and wholesale buyers should contribute to the liquidity here!</h4>
